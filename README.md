# FG Cookie consent

This is a very basic implementation of a cookie consent workflow that does not load any analytics by default then it allows you to accept cookies and load the analyctics or deny and nothing will load.

## Config

FG Cookie Consent has a set of customisable options each with a default:
- `cookieName` defaults to `test-cookie`
- `cookieHtmlMainMessage` defaults to `<p>We use cookies to collect information about how you use this site.<br />We use this information to make the website work as well as possible and improve our services.<br /><a href="/privacy">Learn more about how we use cookies</a></p>`
- `cookiesAcceptCookiesButtonText` defaults to `Accept all cookies`
- `cookiesRejectCookiesButtonText` defaults to `Do not accept`
